                        <p>
                            According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Children – that India ratified in 1992 – all children are born with fundamental rights.
Right to Survival – to life, health, nutrition, name, nationality
Right to Development – to education, care, leisure, recreation, cultural activities
Right to Protection – from exploitation, abuse, neglect
Right to Participation – to expression, information, thought, religion
And a right to achieve these dreams. Even though India’s children account for more than one-third of its population, their interests have never been given priority. And their rights have been violated every single day.

                        <p>
                            Non-discrimination means that all children have the same right to develop their potential in all situations and at all times. For example, every child should have equal access to education regardless of the child’s gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, parentage, sexual orientation or other status
The best interests of the child must be "a primary consideration" in all actions and decisions concerning a child, and must be used to resolve conflicts between different rights. For example, when making national budgetary decisions affecting children, Government must consider how cuts will impact on the best interests of the child
The right to survival and development underscores the vital importance of ensuring access to basic services and to equality of opportunity for children to achieve their full development. For example, a child with a disability should have effective access to education and health care to achieve their full potential
The views of the child mean that the voice of the child must be heard and respected in all matters concerning his or her rights. For example, those in power should consult with children before making decisions that will affect them.

                        <p>
                       Children’s rights are human rights. They protect the child as a human being. As human rights, children’s rights are constituted by fundamental guarantees and essential human rights:
Children’s rights recognize fundamental guarantees to all human beings: the right to life, the non-discrimination principle, the right to dignity through the protection of physical and mental integrity (protection against slavery, torture and bad treatments, etc.)
Children’s rights are civil and political rights, such as the right to identity, the right to a nationality, etc.
Children’s rights are economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to education, the right to a decent standard of living, the right to health, etc.
Children’s rights include individual rights: the right to live with his parents, the right to education, the right to benefit from a protection, etc.
Children’s rights include collective rights: rights of refugee and disabled children, of minority children or from autochtonous groups.
