                <h2>Kirti Bharti</h2>
                <p>
                    This 29-year-old activist has stopped 900 child marriages in the last four years and annulled 150 marriages involving underage boys and girls. A resident of Rajasthan, Kirti Bharti has dedicated her life to protecting helpless children whose families force them into marriage at a young age. She founded Saarthi Trust in 2012, a non-profit organization that protects victims of child marriages. Over the year, Kirti has received several death threats from villagers, caste councils and local politicians because of the nature of her work and the fact that many in the state still practice honour killings. A 2014 UNICEF report states that 47% of India’s girls are married before the age of 18. This heinous practice, a byproduct of a patriarchal society, has been going on even after the Indian government passed the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006. Kirti is a rehabilitation psychologist and has worked with countless children who have been traumatized due to their childhood experiences.

                <h2>Kailash Satyarthi</h2>
                <p>
                    Well-known child rights and education activist, Kailash Satyarthi is credited with rescuing more than 80,000 children from child and bonded labour since the 1980s. He started the Bachpan Bachao Andolan in 1980. It was his tireless efforts that compelled the International Labour Organization to adopt convention no. 182 to abolish the worst forms of child labour. Interestingly, India is one of the 15 member countries that have not ratified it yet since it became effective in 2000. Satyarthi, 62, has raided factories, brick kilns and carpet-making shops to rescue innocent children caught in the web of modern slavery. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.

                <h2>Lakshmi Agarwal</h2>
                <p>
                    An acid attack survivor, Lakshmi Agarwal became an activist after she was attacked with acid by a group of men in 2005 because she had rejected one of the men’s advances. She is director of the Chhanv Foundation, an NGO that fights for the cause of acid attack victims in India. She gained widespread appreciation for campaigning against acid attacks and gathering 27,000 signatures for Public Interest Litigation (PIL) to curb the sale of acid, which led the Supreme Court to order central and state governments to regulate the sale of acid and the Parliament to make justice more accessible for acid attack victims. In 2014, Laxmi received the International Women of Courage award from First Lady of the US, Michelle Obama, and was also named NDTV Indian of the Year in 2014.
